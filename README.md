# Javascript promises kata
A kata to practice with asynchronous code

## Description
Our customer need you to develop an interactive map where:

1. We have to place a pin for every city
2. If you click on one pin, you will display
  - Information from Wikipedia
  - Images from Instagram, Google Images, etc..
3. If you click two cities you will display the exchange rate between the two cities' country

## Notes
You can get a full list of cities of the world from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David-Haim/CountriesToCitiesJSON/master/countriesToCities.json

To place every pin correctly you can use:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start

And for a world map image the customer suggest this image:

but maybe the image will change, be smart :)

For the exchange rate api, please see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3139879/how-do-i-get-currency-exchange-rates-via-an-api-such-as-google-finance 

## Don't be shy

If you want to share what you came up with, don't hesitate to open an issue with a link to your repository. I will link it here and we both will live a long and happy life.
